# What is Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)?

## 📌 Introduction
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) form the foundation of computer science.  
They help us **store, organize, process, and retrieve data efficiently**.

Without DSA:
- Programs become slow
- Code becomes difficult to maintain
- Large-scale systems fail to perform well

## 📦 What is a Data Structure?
A **Data Structure** is a way of **organizing and storing data** in memory so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

### Examples:
- Array – stores elements in a continuous block of memory
- Linked List – stores elements using pointers
- Stack – follows LIFO (Last In First Out)
- Queue – follows FIFO (First In First Out)
- Tree – stores data in hierarchical form
- Graph – stores connected nodes

## ⚙️ What is an Algorithm?
An **Algorithm** is a **step-by-step procedure** to solve a problem.

### Characteristics of a Good Algorithm:
- Finite (must terminate)
- Correct
- Efficient
- Easy to understand and implement

### Example:
Finding the largest number in an array:
1. Start with the first element as maximum
2. Compare it with the next elements
3. Update the maximum if a larger value is found
4. Continue until the end of the array

## 🧠 Why is DSA Important?
DSA helps you:
- Write **efficient and optimized code**
- Solve **complex problems**
- Clear **coding interviews**
- Build **scalable applications**
- Understand how real systems work

## 🚀 Real-World Applications of DSA
| Data Structure | Usage |
|---------------|------|
| Array | Storing lists, images, tables |
| Stack | Undo/Redo operations |
| Queue | CPU scheduling |
| Linked List | Music playlists |
| Tree | File systems |
| Graph | Social networks, maps |

## ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity
DSA focuses on:
- **Time Complexity** – how fast an algorithm runs
- **Space Complexity** – how much memory it uses

These are represented using **asymptotic notations**:
- Big-O (O)
- Big-Theta (Θ)
- Big-Omega (Ω)
